# Task Manager

## Overview
The **Task Manager** is a simple Java console application designed to manage tasks efficiently. It demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **file handling**, and **exception handling**. The application allows users to:

- Add new tasks
- View existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Persist tasks using a text file

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can Create, Read, and Delete tasks.
- **File Persistence**: Tasks are stored in a `tasks.txt` file to retain data across sessions.
- **User-Friendly Console Interface**: Simple and intuitive menu-driven system.
- **Error Handling**: Prevents crashes due to invalid inputs or file handling errors.

## Technologies Used
- **Java (JDK 8+)**
- **File Handling (BufferedReader & BufferedWriter)**
- **Collections (ArrayList)**
- **Exception Handling**
